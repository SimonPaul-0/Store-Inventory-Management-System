# Store Inventory Management System

This C++ program simulates a basic inventory management system for a small store. The system allows users to add products to the inventory, display the current inventory, and sell products.

## Features

- **Product Class:**
  - Represents a store product with attributes such as ID, name, price, and quantity.
  - Displays product details.

- **Inventory Class:**
  - Manages the store's inventory by allowing the addition of products, displaying the current inventory, and selling products.
  - Implements error handling for product availability during sales.

- **Main Function:**
  - Demonstrates the functionality of the inventory management system.
  - Creates sample products, adds them to the inventory, sells products, and displays the current inventory.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

2. **Run the Executable:**
   - Run the compiled executable.

3. **Follow the Console Instructions:**
   - Follow the console instructions to interact with the inventory management system.
   - Options include adding products, displaying the current inventory, and selling products.

## Example

```cpp
// Example usage in main function
Inventory storeInventory;

Product product1(1, "Laptop", 1200.0, 10);
Product product2(2, "Smartphone", 800.0, 15);

storeInventory.addProduct(product1);
storeInventory.addProduct(product2);
